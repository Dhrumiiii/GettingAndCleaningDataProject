# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This project demonstrates how to clean and tidy a dataset collected from the accelerometers of the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.

## Files

- `run_analysis.R`: Script that processes and cleans the data.
- `tidy_dataset.txt`: A tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and subject.
- `CodeBook.md`: Describes the data and transformations.
- `README.md`: This file explaining the project.

## What the script does:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation.
3. Uses descriptive activity names.
4. Labels the dataset with descriptive variable names.
5. Creates a tidy dataset with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
